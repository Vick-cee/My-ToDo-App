# My-ToDo-App
Here is My ToDo-App i created using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPTS. I used my html to make/do the body.At first, it looks kind of rough so i use my css to style it with bueatiful colors, fonts, and backgorund. Doing so, My-ToDo-App was looking cool but it was missing something...WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS ?? Yes, the functionality is not working. So i added javaScript to make my My-ToDo-App functioning perfectly well.
